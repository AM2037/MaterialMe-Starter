Prep for the Android Associates Developer Certification -- Used API 28 Android 9.0 (Pie) & Android Studio 
============

## Based on Google's Material Me! Sample App (Starter Code)

Using the starter code for the practical on Material Design in the Android
Developer Fundamentals course, I built upon it to add in swipe and drag touch
functionality, sport detail screens expanded upon clicking each list item, 
and localized and translated the app to support other languages. This application
mainly focuses on drilling Material Design principles as well as further exploring
the uses of intents and intent extras from Unit 1. 

Pre-requisites
--------------

For this app you should be familiar with:
* Creating and running apps in Android Studio.
* Creating and editing elements using the Layout Editor, XML, and programmatically.
* Using a RecyclerView to display a list.
